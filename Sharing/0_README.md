### Sharing



<u>*Explanation*</u>:

* ***Rationale**. In general, the complete file system structure (FSS) and its contents should be shared unmodified with peers that aim at reproducing the computational analysis. However, in specific cases it might be desirable to share only parts of the FSS  and/or restructure the FSS. The reduced and/or restructured FSS is then stored (as a compressed file) in the /Sharing directory.  This file should at least indicate what you did (not) share and how/why you restructured the FSS. In addition, document when and who you shared with.* 

* ***Typical use**. A typical use of the \Sharing directory is for support projects in which computational analyses were performed for other researchers as a service (e.g., biomedical, clinical researchers). These researchers might only be interested in the final results (figures and tables) and not in the code that produced these results. That is, they will not aim to repeat the analyses. In such situation, the results and tables can be shared in a (flat) structure that is more convenient for them to browse and use, and that leaves out all code and background documentation.* 

* ***Restrictions**. Sharing an FSS with an (external) colleague may be restricted due to, for example, copyright on pdf files of papers, sensitive/private information (in labjournal.docx), non-open-access of data, etc. Make sure you remove such information from \Sharing* 



*<u>Instructions</u>:* 

* *Remove all Instructions and the Explanation once you have completed the template.*

* *Level of detail: Information provided should be sufficient for someone who was not involved in the project and/or has limited knowledge about the topic,  to understand and reproduce the project.*
