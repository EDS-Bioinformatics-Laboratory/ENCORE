**FSS Navigator** 



**Information about the \.navigate directory**

This directory is used by the FSS Navigator (Navigate.py) to store temporary files (e.g., markdown files that were converted to html). In addition it contains the html template (\_\_navigate-template.html\_\_) for Navigate.html (do not remove this file).



All files in this directory are automatically removed (except this 0_README.md file and the html template) when the FSS Navigator is executed.
