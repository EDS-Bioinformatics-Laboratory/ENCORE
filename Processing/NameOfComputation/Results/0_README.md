  * ***Figures***

  * ***Intermediate results***

* *Use descriptive file names*

* *The important tables and figures should be documented.*

  * *Description of columns in tables*
  * *Table and Figure captions*

*<u>Regeneration of figures and tables:</u>* 

*For any figure or table that ends up in a publication, report, or presentation at meeting, the underlying data and a stand-alone piece of code should be available to regenerate the figure. It also allows easy modification of a figure and to retrieve the data of the figure (instead of having to redo a complete analysis). Equally important, the data of the figure can be further analysed or inspected.*
