*<u>Regeneration of figures and tables:</u>* 

*For any figure or table that ends up in a publication, report, or presentation at meeting, the underlying data and a stand-alone piece of code should be available to regenerate the figure. It also allows easy modification of a figure and to retrieve the data of the figure (instead of having to redo a complete analysis). Equally important, the data of the figure can be further analysed or inspected.*
