# This is the main gitignore template file to be used with 
# the standardized File System Structure (FSS).
# If necessary you can merge other template files (e.g., for a specific
# programming language or the JetBrains environment) with 
# the FSS-template depending on the project.
#
# Rename the (merged) template .gitignore
#
# Documentation:           https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
# Collection of templates: https://github.com/github/gitignore
# See also:                https://linuxize.com/post/gitignore-ignoring-files-in-git/
#
# Notes: 
# 1. use forward slash
#
# 2. Once you have added directories and files to the GitHub repository, then adding 
#    these to gitignore will NOT remove them from the repository. In thise case use 
#    git (bash) to remove unwanted files or directories.
#
# 3. Use git status --ignored to check which files and/or directories are ignored
