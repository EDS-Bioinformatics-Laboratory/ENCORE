### Processing



<u>*Explanation*</u>:

*This is the default GitHub README.md file. Do not change its name.*



*Subdirectories*

* ***0_SoftwareEnvironment**.  General and project-specific information about the used computing environments (programming languages, integrated development environments, package managers).*

* ***Data**. Raw, meta, and pre-processed data*

* ***NameOfComputation**.  Contains all items (e.g., code, documentation, results) belonging to a specific computational analysis.*

  

*<u>Instructions</u>:* 

* *Remove all Instructions and the Explanation once you have completed the template.*

* *Level of detail: Information provided should be sufficient for someone who was not involved in the project and/or has limited knowledge about the topic,  to understand and reproduce the project.* 

  

* *Change 'NameOfComputation' to a more descriptive name. Make, additional \NameOfComputation sub-directories if required.*
  
  * *Different parts of the computational work should be placed in different \NameOfComputation directories to keep the \Processing modular.* 
  * *You may add any prefix (e.g., number, date) to order these directories.*



* *The template below may duplicate (parts of) the 0_PROJECT.md file but, more importantly, should provide a short but clear description of all \NameOfComputation directories. In particular, it should make the dependencies (if any) clear, and should provide instructions of how to execute the code.* 
  * *Since the FSS is the entry point of a project and because the FSS will be shared with peers (not the GitHub repository), it is not necessary (but allowed) to provide a project description in this README file*



*GitHub*

*The Processing directory should be synchronized to the corresponding GitHub repository **without data and results** because there may not be sufficient storage space on GitHub to accommodate this.  Moreover, data and results already reside in the FSS. The FSS remains the point of entry*

* *To exclude specific subdirectories and files from the GitHub repository you should make the appropriate changes to **gitignore-FSS-template** and copy it to **.gitignore**.* 
* *The \Processing directory contains several other gitignore templates for specific languages. To use any of these templates, simply merge its content into .gitignore.  It is considered good practice to keep a single .gitignore in the top-level directory and not in individual subdirectories, which would make debugging more troublesome.*

* *The \Processing directory should contain a <u>github.txt</u> file with the name of  the associated GitHub repository (URL). This file is used by the FSS Navigator*
