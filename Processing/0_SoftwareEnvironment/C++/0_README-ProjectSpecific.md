### C and C++



<u>*Explanation*</u>:

*This file contains basic project information and is shown by default in the FSS Navigator.*



*<u>Instructions</u>:* 

* *Remove all Instructions and the Explanation once you have completed the template.*

* *Level of detail: Information provided should be sufficient for someone who was not involved in the project and/or has limited knowledge about the topic,  to understand and reproduce the project.* 

  

**Project specific information**



*For example,* 

* *Specific tools that were used*
* *Used hardware (e.g., laptop, cluster, GPU)*
* Operating system
* *Package versions and dependencies.*
* *Note: if you have multiple computations, organized in different \NameOfComputation directories, that use different package version, dependencies, etc then it is probably better to store this information in the specific \NameOfComputation directory.* 



====== TEMPLATE STARTS HERE ======

**Hardware specification:** 



**Operating system:**



**Is the project specific information stored in this directory or did you move it to the \NameOfComputation directory?**



**Did you add additional files (e.g., export of your environment) to the computing environment?** [yes/no]



**Export your environment**(s) (e.g., listing the different versions of Python, R, libraries/packages, library dependencies, etc) used for your computations.
