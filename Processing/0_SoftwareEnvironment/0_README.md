# Software Environment



*<u>**Instructions**</u>*

* *Remove instructions once you finalized the content of this file.*
* *This directory contains general and project-specific information about the used computing environments (e.g., used hardware, operating system, programming languages, integrated development environments, package managers).*
* *Environments that are not used can be removed.* 
* *If you use a different environment then add a new subdirectory.*
* *In each directory you find two README files:*

  * ***0_README-General.md** provides some basic information about different environments (e.g., R/Rstudio, Python/PyCharm, Anaconda) for peers not familiar with the used computing environment* 
  * ***0_README-ProjectSpecific.md** provides project-specific information. For example,* 
    * *Specific tools that were used*
    * *Used hardware (e.g., laptop, cluster, GPU)*
    * *Operating system(s)*
    * *Package versions and dependencies.*
    * *Note: if you have multiple computations, organized in different \NameOfComputation directories, that use different package version, dependencies, etc then it is probably better to store this information in the specific \NameOfComputation directory.* 
* *In addition, you may find other files such as cheat sheets, tutorials, and exports of (Anaconda) environments.*

* ***Export your environment**(s) (e.g., listing the different versions of Python, R, libraries/packages, library dependencies, etc) used for your computations. This can, for example, be done with Anaconda (R and Python), or saving your sessionInfo() (R).* 





**Did you complete the 0_README-ProjectSpecific.md file(s)?** [yes/no]
