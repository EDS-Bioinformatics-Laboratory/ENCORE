 **PyCharm and DataSpell**

One may use the PyCharm Python IDE from JetBrains (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The free version of PyCharm does not run Notebooks, for one needs either PyCharm Pro or DataSpell (https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/). DataSpell and other applications are free for lecturers and students.



**Python Pipreqs**

Every Python project should have a `requirements.txt` file. It stores the information of all libraries needed for a project to run, and is essential when deploying Python projects. This is traditionally done via the `pip freeze` command, which outputs all libraries installed in a virtual environment.

If you only want to store the libraries that are actually used in a project then use pipreqs. It does the same thing as `pip freeze`, but better.

**Python 2 versus Python 3**

Python 2 is no longer supported and is not a good choice for development.
