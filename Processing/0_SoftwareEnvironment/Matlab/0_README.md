# Matlab #
MATLAB (an abbreviation of "MATrix LABoratory") is a commercial programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks. The software runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. MATLAB allows interactive matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages. A more recent addition are matlab notebooks: the Live Editor combines code, output, and formatted text in an executable notebook.

Matlab's capabilities can be extended by toolboxes and scripts both [commercial](https://mathworks.com/products.html) and [open source](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange).
