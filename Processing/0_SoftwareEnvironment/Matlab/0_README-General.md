# Matlab #
MATLAB (an abbreviation of "MATrix LABoratory") is a commercial
programming language and numeric computing environment developed by
MathWorks. The software runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. MATLAB
allows interactive matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and
data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and
interfacing with programs written in other languages. A more recent
addition are matlab notebooks: the Live Editor combines code, output,
and formatted text in an executable notebook.

Matlab's capabilities can be extended by toolboxes and scripts both
[commercial](https://mathworks.com/products.html) and [open
source](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange).
